# Elementary Graph Algorithms
This repository keeps the codes to generate videos in my "[Elementary Graph Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWkTpUb3t-2zqd2t4j47Wbw1GsxuQKmdX)" playlist.
My main goal is playing with the Manim animation engine. 
As a byproduct, I try to gain a deeper insight into basic graph algorithms by exploring their different variations.

## Installation
You need the Manim engine (community edition) to run the codes. 
Please refer to installation instructions at the [Manim GitHub repository](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/). 

## Usage
Execute the following command to run a specific example:

```
.\runner.bat .\path\to\python\file.py ClassName
```

You should change the `runner.bat` file to select the video quality.
* `-ql`: Low quality
* `--high-quality`: High quality
